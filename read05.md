# Day Three - The CSS Read:05


>*as we said before CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.*
#### What is CSS?
##### “CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.”
##### CSS was first proposed by Hakom Lie and co-created by Bert Bos around 1996. Created to compliment HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes a website look and feel amazing. Presentation and ease of use have been some of the qualities CSS has brought to web development. It is more involved with changing a websites style rather than its content. Kind of like changing the font size, font color and positioning on a word document. CSS is in charge of the way the content looks on a page and what else goes on it to compliment that content.
