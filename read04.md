## what is JS?
>*JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.*

## what is the relationship between HTML & JS?
>*HTML tags create objects; JavaScript lets you manipulate those objects. For example, you use the HTML <BODY> and </BODY> tags to create a Web page, or document. As shown in Table 1, after that document is created, you can interact with it by using JavaScript.*
#### Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name
1) The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number
#
2) The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name. 
#
3) You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript. 
#
4)  All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.
#
5) Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.
#
6) If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
