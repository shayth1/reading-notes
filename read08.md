## what got abot While loop is
>*while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.*

## what got abot for loop is
>*In computer science, a for-loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly. Various keywords are used to specify this statement: descendants of ALGOL use "for", while descendants of Fortran use "do".*
#
>example for loop:


`let array = ["foo", "bar"]`

`let low = 0; // the index to start at`
`let high = array.length; // can also be a number`

`for(let i = low; i < high; i++) { 
  // the variable i is the index, which is
  // the amount of times the loop has looped already
  console.log(i);
  console.log(array[i]); 
} `

> example while loop:

`while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}`
